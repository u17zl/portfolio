# Writing up a walkthrough of CTF

## Introduction：

FristiLeaks is a VM created by Ar0xA and the difficulty rating is descriped as basic. This CTF challenge involves penetrating methodologies such as port scanning, server fingerprinting, webshell reverse, SSRF, etc. The challenge goal is to get root access and catch flag.

## VulnHub – FristiLeaks_1.3

### VM download:

- Download (Mirror): https://download.vulnhub.com/fristileaks/FristiLeaks_1.3.ova
- Download (Torrent): https://download.vulnhub.com/fristileaks/FristiLeaks_1.3.ova.torrent

### VM environment:

- Virtualbox
- VMware Workstation player

### Settings:

User will need to manually edit the s MAC address to: 08:00:27:A5:A6:76

## Exploitation:

### IP address:

![image text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/1.png)

The target IP is 192.168.0.110

### Port Scanning:

Running Nmap

```
nmap -p- -sS -sV -vv 192.168.0.110
```

over the VM revealed that the only common port that was open, was port 80, which it identified as running Apache on CentOS:

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.2.15 ((CentOS) DAV/2 PHP/5.3.3)
```

### Robots.txt

- I browsed IP address and this is what it looks like:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/index.png)

- Let us try if there something in 192.168.0.110/Robots.txt

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/robots.png)

- robots.txt: 3 disallowed entries:

```
/cola
/sisi
/beer
```

- However, every page looked like the same, as follow:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/cola.png)

Nothing special in these pages.

### KEEP CALM AND DRINK FRISTI

- This is what I saw in index page, so there should have some hints. Let's try http://192.168.0.110/fristi/

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/login.png)

- Tried some combo of admin and password, and different forms of SQLi, but I did not be able to login.
- Never just look at the surface! we should look at the source code. Wow!

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/login_html.png)

- There was a message, which was left by a man named eezeepz.
- Then there's the possibility that admin might use eezeepz as his username or password.
- Look though down. We saw a large block of base64-encoded codes:

```

- Decode it and save it as png file:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/decode.png)

- It looks like a password, try

```
username:eezeepz password:keKkeKKeKKeKkEkkEk
```

- Bingo, we made it and there is a pciture upload function.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/upload1.png)

- Needless to say, a php shell cannot be better.
- Shell can download here: http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell
- Do not forget to modify source code. Edit the following lines of php-reverse-shell.php:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/php_shell.png)

- uploaded it, but got the response of wrong file type, possibly because there is a filter in backend.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/php_wrong.png)

- No worries, just added a jpg extension to the php reverse shell, then I launched the netcat listener and then I opened the shell we uploaded. Connection established.

### Privilege Escalation

- Checked through direcories, see what can be exploited. It seems that there is something interesting in /HOME, try it out:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/cdhome.png)

- We do not have access of admin:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/admindeny.png)

- There is a old friend, eezeepz. See what inside:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/cdeeze.png)

- There is a notes.txt file that interests me:

```
sh-4.1$ cat notes.txt
cat notes.txt
Yo EZ,

I made it possible for you to do some automated checks,
but I did only allow you access to /usr/bin/* system binaries. I did
however copy a few extra often needed commands to my
homedir: chmod, df, cat, echo, ps, grep, egrep so you can use those
from /home/admin/

Don't forget to specify the full path for each binary!

Just put a file called "runthis" in /tmp/, each line one command. The
output goes to the file "cronresult" in /tmp/. It should
run every minute with my account privileges.

- Jerry
```

- Nice! We got a hint, just followed it:

```
sh-4.1$ touch /tmp/runthis
sh-4.1$ echo "/home/admin/chmod 777 /home/admin" > /tmp/runthis
```

- Then we have got the privilege of admin:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/cdadmin.png)

- Now inside it I could see a bunch of interesting files, some encrypted files and a python script used to encrypt the files.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/cryptedtxt.png)
![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/python.png)

- It seems that these files are encoded with this python file. Use it to decode:

```
root@kali:~# python cryptpass.py mVGZ3O3omkJLmy2pcuTq
thisisalsopw123
root@kali:~# python cryptpass.py =RFn0AKnlMHMPIzpyuTI0ITG
LetThereBeFristi!
```

- One if them could be password of fristigod, let's have a try. Something went wrong with tty. Instead the fristigod user was able to run the sudo command as follow:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/tty.png)

- After that, we could use it as normal. Inside it there was some secret file.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/vvar_fristigod.png)

- Further, I checked doCom in ./.secret_admin_stuff

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/trydoCom.png)

```
sh-4.1$ ./doCom
doCom
Nice try, but wrong user ;)
```

- Found that this a file of user root, I currently cannot access to it. Went back and checked .bash_history

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/bash_history.png)

- The hint is that fristigod was always using command `sudo -u`. Addtionaly, doCom looks like a execution that runs command line.
- Checked it out and it needs password. We could try what we got previously:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/sudo-l.png)

- Use`bash-4.1$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom /bin/bash` to generate a shell:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/getroot.png)

- Ok, it successed!
- Back to `/root` directory and cathe the flag:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u17zl/Something-Awesome/master/src/flag.png)

- FLAG:

```
Congratulations on beating FristiLeaks 1.0 by Ar0xA [https://tldr.nu]

I wonder if you beat it in the maximum 4 hours it's supposed to take!

Shoutout to people of #fristileaks (twitter) and #vulnhub (FreeNode)


Flag: Y0u_kn0w_y0u_l0ve_fr1st1
```

- VM rooted and completed!

## Conclusion

This a very interesting CTF challenge, involving a bunch of pentesting methodologies, which makes me learn a lot from this process. Thanks again to author Ar0xA for this CTF challenge!
