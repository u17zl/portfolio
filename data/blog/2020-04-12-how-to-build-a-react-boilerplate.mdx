How to build a react boilerplate from scratch using Webpack 4 and Babel

## Intro

The most common and popular way to build a react app is to use `creat-react-app`, but in this project I am going to build a react boilerplate from scratch.

## Folder Structure

- src
  - components
  - styles

```bash
mkdir react-boilerplate
cd react-boilerplate
mkdir -p src/components src/styles
```

## Initialize the Project

```bash
npm init
```

Now `package.json` will look like this below:

```json
//package.json
{
  "name": "react-boilerplate",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Installing Webpack

```bash
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

- webpack module — which include all core webpack functionality
- webpack-cli — enable running webpack from the command line

## Installing React

```bash
npm install react react-dom --save
```

## Installing Babel

```bash
npm install @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
```

- babel-core: Transforms ES6 code to ES5
- babel-loader: Webpack helper to transpile code, given the the preset.
- babel-preset-env: Preset which helps babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 code to ES5.
- babel-preset-react: Preset which Transforms JSX to JavaScript.

## Basic Files

Create 2 new files named `index.js` and `index.html`

- src
  - components
  - styles
  - index.js
  - index.html

```js
//index.js
console.log('hello')
```

```html
//index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>React Boilerplate</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Entry and Output file

Create `webpack.config.js` in root directory of the project so that we can define rules for our loaders.

```js
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, '/dist'),
    filename: 'index_bundle.js',
  },
}
```

In the above code, Webpack will bundle all of our JavaScript files into `index-bundle.js` file inside the `/dist` directory.

## Webpack Loaders

Loaders in `webpack.config.js` file are responsible for loading and bundling the source files.

```js
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, '/dist'),
    filename: 'index_bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

- babel-loader: load our JSX/JavaScript files
- css-loader: load and bundle all of the CSS files into one file
- style-loader: add all of the styles inside the style tag of the document

#### Before using css-loader and style-loader, we should install them as a dev-dependency.

```bash
npm install css-loader style-loader --save-dev
```

### .babelrc:

Create .babelrc file inside root of the project directory with the following contents inside of it.

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

This file will tell babel which presets to use for transpiling the code. Here we are using two presets:

- env: This preset is used to transpile the ES6/ES7/ES8 code to ES5.
- react: This preset is used to transpile JSX code to ES5.

## Compiling files using Webpack

Add these lines of code inside the script object of the `package.json` file as below:

```json
"start": "webpack --mode development --watch",
"build": "webpack --mode production"
```

So scripts will look like this below:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "webpack --mode development --watch",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },
```

`--watch` flag is to automatically compile all the source files in any changes

There are two modes in webpack 4:

- `--mode production` mode which produces optimized files ready for use in production
- `--mode development` mode which produces easy to read code and gives you best development experience.

Now you can compile the project using below command:

```bash
npm start
```

Then you will see how output part in `webpack.config.js` is working since `index_bundle.js` file created under the `/dist` directory which will contain transpiled ES5 code from `index.js` file.

### App.js

Create `/src/components/App.js`

```js
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react'

import '../styles/App.css'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My React App!</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

### App.css

Create `/src/styles/App.css`

```css
// App.css

h1 {
  color: #27aedb;
  text-align: center;
}
```

This CSS file is used to test whether the css-loader and style-loader are working correctly or not

Now we can modify our `index.js` file we created earlier in the `/src` directory

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './components/App.js'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

## Installing Html-webpack-plugin

So far we already have `index_bundle.js` in `/dist` directory, we also need HTML file. So let us install html-webpack-plugin, this plugin generates an HTML file, injects the script inside the HTML file and writes this file to `dist/index.html`.

Install the html-webpack-plugin as a dev-dependency:

```bash
npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

This is a plugin, so that we add it inside the webpack.config.js file

```js
const path = require('path')
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, '/dist'),
    filename: 'index-bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ['babel-loader'],
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
    }),
  ],
}
```

It uses `/src/index.html` file as a template and generates new file `/dist/index.html` with the script injected.

Almost finished! Let us compile the source files using webpack:

```bash
npm start
```

Open `/dist/index.html` in a web browser, you will see the text "My React App!"

## Installing Webpack-dev-server

To have webpack watch our changes and refresh webpage whenever any change is made to our components, we can install webpack-dev-server.

Install webpack-dev-server as a dev-dependency

```bash
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

Then modify `package.json` start script like below:

```json
"start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open --hot"
```

`--open` and `--hot` represents that it will open and refresh the web page whenever any change is made to components.

## Adding source map for better error logs

Since webpack bundles the code, source maps are mandatory to get a reference to the original file that raised an error. For example, if you bundle three source files (a.js, b.js, and c.js) into one bundle (bundler.js) and one of the source files contains an error, the stack trace will simply point to bundle.js. This is problematic as you probably want to know exactly if it’s the a, b, or c file that is causing an error.

You can tell webpack to generate source maps using the devtool property of the configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  // … the rest of the config
}
```

## Setting up ESLint

Linter is a program that checks our code for any error or warning that can cause bugs. JavaScript’s linter, ESLint, is a very flexible linting program that can be configured in many ways.

But before we get ahead, let’s install ESLint into our project:

```bash
npm --save-dev install eslint eslint-loader babel-eslint eslint-config-react eslint-plugin-react
```

- **eslint** is the core dependency for all functionalities, while **eslint-loader** enables us to hook eslint into webpack. Now since React used ES6+ syntax, we will add **babel-eslint** — a parser that enables eslint to lint all valid ES6+ codes.
- **eslint-config-react** and **eslint-plugin-react** are both used to enable ESLint to use pre-made rules.

Since we already have webpack, we only have to modify the config slightly:

```js
module.exports = {
  // modify the module
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ['babel-loader', 'eslint-loader'], // include eslint-loader
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Then create an eslint config file named `.eslintrc` with this content:

```json
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "extends": "react",
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "detect"
    }
  }
}
```

The config is basically saying, “Hey ESLint, please parse the code using babel-eslint before you check it, and when you’re checking it, please check if all the rules from our React rules config is passed. Take global variables from the environment of browser and node. Oh, and if it’s React code, take the version from the module itself. That way the user won’t have to specify the version manually.”

Rather than specifying our own rules manually, we simply extend react rules which were made available by eslint-config-react and eslint-plugin-react.

#### errors in eslint

There’s a quick way to fix ESLint errors by using `eslint--fix`, and it’s actually good for a quick fix. Let’s add a script on our `package.json` file:

```js
"eslint-fix": “eslint --fix \"src/**/*.js\"", // the eslint script
```

Then run it with `npm run eslint-fix`

## Adding CSS LESS processor

In order to add the LESS processor into our React application, we will require both less and loader packages from webpack:

```bash
npm install --save-dev less less-loader css-loader style-loader
```

- **less-loader**: will compile our less file into css
- **css-loader**: will resolve css syntax like import or url().
- **style-loader**: will get our compiled css and load it up into `<style>` tag in our `bundle.js`. This is great for development because it lets us update our style on the fly, without needing to refresh the browser.

Let's change `/src/styles/App.css` into `/src/styles/App.less`

```less
@color: #27aedb;
h1 {
  color: @color;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Now import our `App.less` file from `/components/index.js`:

```js
import '../styles/App.less'
```

Then update our webpack configuration module property:

```js
  {
    test: /\.less$/,
    use: [
      'style-loader',
      'css-loader',
      'less-loader',
    ],
  }
```

## Final Todos

Final file structure:

- dist
- node_modules
- src
  - components
    - App.js
  - styles
    - App.css
  - index.html
  - index.js
- .babelrc
- .gitignore
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- webpack.config.js
- README.md

In `.gitignore`, we should add `dist/` and `node_modules/`

```md
node_modules/
dist/
```

Last thing is to run:

```
npm start
```

Enjoy it!
